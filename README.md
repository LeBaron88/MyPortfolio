# My Portfolio
This is my portfolio website built in React on the client side and Node/Express on the server.

Go ahead and fork/clone the project to your local repo to make it your own by either updating the source code or if you like the presentation and would only update the data, there is a template file called config.JSON inside the data folder on the root that you can modify.

Note. I have used Redux to manage my state data.
